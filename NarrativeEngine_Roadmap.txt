# The Narrative Engine: Dual Development Roadmap

## 🧭 Dual Development Plan  
**For:**  
- 🎲 Your **DnD Game Implementation** (Solo and Family Campaigns)  
- 🧠 The broader **Narrative Engine Platform**

---

### 🧩 PHASE 1: Core Engine Infrastructure (Now–Month 1)

#### 🔧 1. Finalize Modular Architecture (already underway)
- ✅ Organize files into `/narrative_core/`, `/dnd_game/`, `/shared/`, etc.
- 🔁 Ensure each module has clean interfaces:
  - `MemoryCore`
  - `NarrativeInterpreter`
  - `WorldStateSimulator`
  - `AIActorFramework`
  - `OutputLayer`

#### 🧠 2. Lock in Memory System MVP
- Implement layered memory: `short_term`, `mid_term`, `long_term`
- Include:
  - Memory decay functions
  - Emotional tagging
  - Thematic recall
- Integrate `VectorMemoryModule` for similarity search

#### 🎲 3. DnD Rules & Player Input Processing
- Implement `RulesAndLogicManager` for SRD 5.1
- Build natural language → action parsing:
  - Use regex/fallbacks for expressions like `2d6+3`
  - Tag intents: `attack`, `move`, `ask`, `remember`, `explore`

#### 🌐 4. Frontend/UI Hookup
- Confirm full integration of:
  - Localhost React frontend
  - Markdown-rendered text
  - Memory trace logs
- Add toggles for:
  - “Developer Mode”
  - “Immersive Mode”

---

### 🔍 PHASE 2: Narrative Continuity, Emotional Intelligence (Month 1–2)

#### 🧬 5. Contextual Drift Solutions
- Weight past memory recall based on:
  - Relevance
  - Emotional tone
  - Recency
- Add user prompts for:
  - `remember this`
  - `forget that`
  - `why did you say that?`

#### ❤️ 6. Emotional Memory + NPC Psychology
- Each NPC gets:
  - Emotion tracker
  - Memory profile
  - Relationship arcs

#### 🔥 7. Adaptive Story Beats
- Allow:
  - “Narrative hooks” to trigger based on moral themes
  - Emergent quests triggered by actions
- Trace causes/consequences across sessions

---

### 🧪 PHASE 3: Narrative Simulation Tools (Month 2–4)

#### 🧠 8. Storyteller View
- Custom interface to:
  - View memory entries
  - Adjust relationship weights
  - Force consequences
  - Pin/delete world events

#### 🌎 9. Non-DnD Narrative Domains
- Add folders:
  - `/therapy_sim/`
  - `/historical_sim/`
  - `/corporate_brand_sim/`
- Fork memory/output modules with domain rules

---

### 🚀 PHASE 4: Voice + Immersive Extensions (Month 4–6)

#### 🎙️ 10. Voice Interface
- Integrate Whisper
- Optional: TTS with `pyttsx3` or `ElevenLabs`

#### 🧠 11. Personal Memory Agent Mode
- Persona uses memory engine for:
  - Journaling
  - Life coaching
  - Therapy sandbox

#### 🧱 12. World-State Visual Interface
- Map visual with:
  - Factions
  - City events
  - Quest states

## 📘 Manifesto Compliance

| Principle                             | Implementation Example                         |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Memory is sacred                     | Vector recall + decay                          |
| Story is interpretive, not generative| Moral consequence + tone-aware response        |
| The user co-authors the world        | Persistent choices shape quests + relationships|
| Emotional realism matters            | NPC tone-matching + arcs                       |
| Narrative continuity is critical     | Trace logs + memory recall                     |
| System must scale beyond games       | Add therapy/historical simulation modules      |
