# DnD 5E AI-Powered Campaign Manager - Complete Project Foundation

## Project Overview
Successfully built a comprehensive AI-powered DnD 5E campaign management system with advanced session logging, memory systems, and content generation capabilities.

## Core Systems Implemented

### 1. Session Logging System (`core/session_logger.py`)
- **Dialogue Logging**: Track conversations with speaker identification
- **Action Logging**: Record character actions with entity extraction
- **Combat Logging**: Document combat encounters and outcomes
- **Exploration Logging**: Track location visits and discoveries
- **Decision Logging**: Record player decisions and consequences
- **Session Summaries**: Automatic generation of session summaries with:
  - Duration tracking
  - Locations visited
  - NPCs encountered
  - Major events
  - Items found
  - Combat encounters
  - Decisions made

### 2. AI Memory System (`core/memory_system.py`)
- **Entity Tracking**: Automatically extract and track NPCs, locations, items, events
- **Relationship Mapping**: Build connections between entities across sessions
- **Context Understanding**: AI-like analysis of session content
- **Continuity Verification**: Ensure consistency across campaign sessions
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient storage and querying of campaign knowledge
- **Memory Search**: Semantic search through campaign history

### 3. Character Management (`core/character_manager.py`)
- **Vibe-Based Creation**: Generate characters from descriptive prompts
- **Race/Class Integration**: Automatic race and class selection based on descriptions
- **Background Generation**: Create character backgrounds and personality traits
- **Character Persistence**: Save and load character data
- **Level Tracking**: Monitor character progression

### 4. AI Content Generator (`core/ai_content_generator.py`)
- **NPC Generation**: Create detailed NPCs with personalities and motivations
- **Location Generation**: Generate rich, detailed locations
- **Quest Generation**: Create engaging quests with objectives and rewards
- **Context-Aware**: Generate content based on campaign context and player levels
- **Memory Integration**: Use campaign memory to inform content generation

### 5. Development Journal System (`core/development_journal.py`)
- **Progress Tracking**: Document development milestones and achievements
- **Idea Management**: Capture and organize feature ideas
- **Bug Tracking**: Record issues and fixes
- **Time Tracking**: Monitor estimated vs actual development time
- **Milestone Management**: Set and track development goals
- **Search and Filter**: Find entries by type, priority, status, tags
- **Export/Backup**: Full data export and backup capabilities
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for journal management
